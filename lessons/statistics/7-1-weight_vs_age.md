[Think Stats Chapter 7 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2008.html#toc70) (weight vs. age)

Pr( identical | twin brother) = Pr(identical & twin brother) / Pr(twin brother)

Pr(identical & twin brother) = (1/2)*(1/300)

Pr(twin brother) = (1/2)*(1/300) + (1/4)*(1/125) ... twin fraternal brother and twin identical brother are mutually exclusive. 

Pr(identical | twin brother) = (1/2)*(1/300) / ( (1/2)*(1/300) + (1/4) * (1/125) ) =  5/11
